# Dice Bot [![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

A simple Telegram bot that lets you roll a dice.

## Usage
To roll a standard six-sided dice you can just use `/roll`.
You can also fancy it up and use a ten-sided dice with `/roll d10`.
Or even roll multiple die with `/roll 4d20` for four 20-sided die.
Maybe you want to go mayham? `/roll 100d100` for 100 100-sided die!

It's up to you :D

# On Telegram

Since `@DiceBot` and many variants were already taken, I resorted to [@Rolling_Dice_Bot](https://t.me/Rolling_Dice_Bot).
I know, shitty name. But I had no better idea lol.
